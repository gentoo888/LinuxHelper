Ok.. this is my first project on github... Introducing to you: LinuxHelper! LinuxHelper is an intelligent Linux distribution recommender and USB installer that analyzes your hardware and preferences to suggest the most suitable Linux distributions for your system.

## üåü Features

- **Hardware Detection**: Automatically scans and analyzes your CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggests Linux distributions based on your hardware capabilities and preferences
- **Visual Customization**: Choose between performance-focused or visually appealing distributions
- **Usage Optimization**: Tailored recommendations for gaming, office work, or software development
- **One-Click Installation**: Downloads your chosen distribution and writes it directly to a USB drive
- **Seamless Experience**: Handles the entire process from recommendation to reboot

</p>

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download the project from the github site
2. Go ahead and run the LinuxHelper.exe with admin privileges.
Note: If the .exe gives library error, you need to install these 4 libraries: pillow (for showing the distros's logos in the recommendation screen), tkinter (for GUI), Psutil (for probing most of your hardware) and finally GPutil (for probing your GPU model). You can install each of them with the `pip install <library>` command.

## System Requirements
- Windows 8 or later (required for advanced boot options)
- Administrator privileges (required for USB writing)
- Internet connection (for downloading ISO files)
- USB drive (4GB+ recommended) for installation
- Python 3.6+ (if running from source)


## üîß How It Works

1. **Hardware Analysis**: LinuxHelper scans your system's CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage
2. **Preference Selection**: Choose your usage needs and visual preferences
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Intelligent algorithm suggests the most suitable distributions
4. **ISO Download**: Downloads your selected distribution from secure sources
5. **USB Writing**: Creates a bootable USB drive with your chosen distribution
6. **Reboot Option**: Optionally reboot directly to BIOS/boot menu

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies/Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter for GUI
- PyInstaller for executable creation
- Pillow for image support on the app
- GPutil for GPU probing
- Hardware detection libraries (psutil)
- PowerShell integration for system operations
